🧑‍💼 Online Employee Recruitment System (Python Project)

Introduction

The Online Employee Recruitment System is a Python-based application designed to automate the recruitment process for organizations. The traditional recruitment method is time-consuming and prone to errors. This system allows administrators to manage job postings, view and filter candidate profiles, and gather feedback. On the other hand, users (job seekers) can register, apply for jobs, update their profiles, view vacancies, and provide feedback.
The system consists of two main roles: Admin and Employee. This project reduces paperwork, simplifies candidate tracking, and improves hiring efficiency.
